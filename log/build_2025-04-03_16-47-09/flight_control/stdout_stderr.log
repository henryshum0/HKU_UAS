[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmatplotplusplus.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "matplotplusplus", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "matplotplusplus"
  with any of the following names:

    matplotplusplusConfig.cmake
    matplotplusplus-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "matplotplusplus" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "matplotplusplus_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "matplotplusplus" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
