[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmatplot.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "matplot", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "matplot" with any
  of the following names:

    matplotConfig.cmake
    matplot-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "matplot" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "matplot_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "matplot" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
